create Chart for the games sales in 2016

This ist the online store "Ice" which sells video games from all over the world. the Dataset related to user and expert game reviews, genre, platform (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), and historical game sales data are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game can be said to be successful or not. That way, you can find the games with the most potential and plan their advertising campaigns.

In front of you is data from 2016. Try to imagine that now it is December 2016 and you are planning a campaign for 2017.
(The most important thing is to gain experience in working with data. It doesn't matter whether you forecast 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or forecast 2027 sales based on data from 2026.).

This dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. ESRB is an abbreviation for Entertainment Software Rating Board, which is an independent regulatory organization that evaluates game content and assigns age ratings such as Teen or Mature.
